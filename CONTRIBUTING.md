## Code Guidelines

### Python Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Include comprehensive docstrings
- Add type hints where appropriate
- Keep functions focused and modular

### Mathematical Code
- Document all physical assumptions

- Validate against known limits and cases

### Example Code Structure
```python
def calculate_energy_density(radius: float, velocity: float) -> Dict[str, float]:
    """
    Calculate negative energy density for exotic matter.
    
    Args:
        radius: Characteristic length scale (meters)
        velocity: Warp velocity as fraction of c (dimensionless)
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing energy calculations with units
        
    References:
        [1] Alcubierre, M. (1994). The Warp Drive: hyper-fast travel within general relativity
    """
    # Implementation with clear physical reasoning
    pass
```

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- All new functions must include unit tests
- Tests should cover edge cases and physical limits
- Use pytest framework for testing
- Aim for >90% code coverage

### Physical Validation
- Verify dimensional consistency
- Check limiting cases (e.g., v→0, r→∞)
- Compare with analytical solutions where available
- Validate against published results

### Integration Tests
- Test interaction between different modules
- Verify end-to-end workflows
- Check numerical stability

## Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation
