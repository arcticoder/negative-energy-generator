## 🛠️ Implementation Details

### Control Algorithm
```python
# Adaptive PID with gain scheduling
kp, ki, kd = adaptive_gains(error, energy_state)
control_output = kp*error + ki*error_integral + kd*error_derivative
```

### Sensor Fusion
```python
# Multi-modal energy density estimation
phase_energy = -1e-8 * sin(phase_measurement * 1e6)
temp_energy = -2e-9 * (temperature - 0.001)
fused_energy = 0.7*phase_energy + 0.3*temp_energy
```

### Constraint Satisfaction
```python
# Real-time constraint monitoring
if energy_density >= 0 or abs(energy_density) > threshold:
    constraint_violations += 1
satisfaction_rate = (1 - violations/total_steps) * 100
```
