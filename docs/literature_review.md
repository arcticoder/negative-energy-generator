# Macroscopic Negative Energy Literature Review

**Date:** 2025-08-01

## Objective
Gather and summarize key publications on macroscopic sources of negative energy for potential warp-drive enabling configurations.

## Outline

1. Introduction to Negative Energy in Quantum Field Theory
   - Role of stress-energy tensor and energy conditions
   - Motivation for macroscopic exploitation

2. Casimir Effect in Parallel Plate and Multi-Plate Geometries
   - Original Casimir (1948): H. B. G. Casimir, "On the attraction between two perfectly conducting plates"
   - Reviews and experiments:
     - M. J. Sparnaay, "Measurements of attractive forces between flat plates"
     - S. K. Lamoreaux, "Demonstration of the Casimir force in the 0.6 to 6 μm range"
   - Multi-plate enhancements and metamaterial proposals

3. Quantum Squeezed Vacuum States and Negative Energy Density
   - Foundations: C. M. Caves, "Quantum-mechanical noise in an interferometer"
   - Applications in gravitational-wave detectors and proposals for negative energy extraction

4. Other Macroscopic Proposals
   - Wormholes and exotic matter requirements (Morris & Thorne, 1988)
   - Dynamic Casimir effect (Wilson et al., 2011)
   - Optical analogues and metamaterial implementations

5. Summary of Practical Feasibility and Experimental Status
   - Measured magnitudes of negative energy density
   - Scaling limitations and uncertainties
