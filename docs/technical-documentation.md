## Mathematical Framework

### Negative Energy Density Calculation
The core negative energy density is computed using the modified stress-energy tensor:

```
T_μν = T_μν^(matter) + T_μν^(quantum) + T_μν^(polymer)
```

where polymer corrections provide the mechanism for sustained ANEC violations.

### Control System Design
The H∞ controller minimizes the cost function:

```
J = ∫[x^T Q x + u^T R u] dt
```

subject to robust stability constraints and actuator limitations.

### LIV Physics Integration
Lorentz invariance violations are parameterized through modified dispersion relations:

```
E² = p²c² + m²c⁴ + δ_n (E/M_Planck)^n
```

with experimental constraints from UHECR and photon observations.
