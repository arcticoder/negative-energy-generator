#### 5. Semiclassical Backreaction Module

This component implements a toy model of 1+1D semiclassical gravity, evolving a metric perturbation h(t,x) under a prescribed stress-energy source T_{00}(x).

##### 5.1 Governing Equation
We solve the discretized wave-like equation:
```
∂²_t h(t,x) = ∂²_x h(t,x) + 8πG T_{00}(x)
```
with periodic boundary conditions on x.

##### 5.2 Numerical Integration
We use a leapfrog scheme:
```
h_next = 2 h - h_prev + dt² [Δ_x h + 8π G T00]
```
where Δ_x h is the discrete Laplacian:
```
( h_{i+1} - 2 h_i + h_{i-1} ) / dx²
```

##### 5.3 API Usage
```python
from simulation.backreaction import solve_semiclassical_metric

# Define spatial grid and source
x = np.linspace(0, L, N)
T00 = compute_energy_density(phi, phi_dt)

# Run solver
dt = 0.001
steps = 100
h_final, history = solve_semiclassical_metric(x, T00, dt=dt, steps=steps, G=1.0)

# history has shape (steps+1, N), with history[0] = 0 and history[-1] = h_final
```

## Mathematical Framework

### Negative Energy Density Calculation
The core negative energy density is computed using the modified stress-energy tensor:

```
T_μν = T_μν^(matter) + T_μν^(quantum) + T_μν^(polymer)
```

where polymer corrections provide the mechanism for sustained ANEC violations.

### Control System Design
The H∞ controller minimizes the cost function:

```
J = ∫[x^T Q x + u^T R u] dt
```

subject to robust stability constraints and actuator limitations.

### LIV Physics Integration
Lorentz invariance violations are parameterized through modified dispersion relations:

```
E² = p²c² + m²c⁴ + δ_n (E/M_Planck)^n
```

with experimental constraints from UHECR and photon observations.
