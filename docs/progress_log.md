# Progress Log

## 2025-08-01

### Repository Status
- Negative-energy-generator framework repository active; core QFT backend and analysis modules implemented.

### Completed to Date
- Implemented core simulation methods: `local_energy_density`, `find_negative`, `evolve_QFT`, `build_quantum_op_tensor`, `detect_exotics`, and `verify_conservation`.
- Defined Verification & Validation (V&V) tasks in `VnV-TODO.ndjson` and Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) tasks in `UQ-TODO.ndjson` for QFT backend features.
- Created `docs/literature_review.md` summarizing key publications on macroscopic negative energy sources.

### In Progress
- Integration tests for stress-energy conservation (`verify_conservation`).
- UQ experiments: Monte Carlo sampling, time-step sensitivity, grid resolution analysis for QFT outputs.
- Implementing 1+1D lattice QFT solver in `src/simulation/lattice_qft.py` for real scalar fields (finite-difference Klein–Gordon).
- Developed parameter sweep orchestrator in `src/simulation/parameter_sweep.py` for ansatz and grid sweeps.
- Created unit tests in `tests/test_lattice_energy.py` validating energy density calculations and solver output shapes.
- Created command-line demo `scripts/lattice_sweep_demo.py` showcasing sweep execution and result summaries.
- Created discretization accuracy test in `tests/test_lattice_discretization.py` verifying discrete Laplacian against analytical solution.

### Next Tasks
1. Update V&V and UQ trackers with tasks for lattice solver validation and uncertainty quantification of lattice energy densities.
2. Implement finite-difference time-integration in `solve_klein_gordon` for dynamic field evolution.
3. Configure CI workflow (e.g., GitHub Actions) to run unit tests, integration tests, and CLI demo automatically.
4. Implement integration test for HDF5 export result validation (`test_parameter_sweep_export.py`).
5. Review and optimize time-integration accuracy in `solve_klein_gordon` based on discretization test outcomes.

```latest-progress
I’ve added a discretization unit test for the Laplacian and updated the progress log. Next, I recommend setting up a CI workflow to automatically run all tests and the CLI demo—ensuring stability—and writing the HDF5 export integration test. I can scaffold a GitHub Actions config if you’d like.
```
```progress
V&V and UQ trackers updated with high- and medium-priority tasks for the lattice QFT solver, HDF5 exports, and parameter sensitivities. The progress log and test/demo scripts are in place. Next, I recommend implementing the discretization unit test or refining the solver's accuracy. Let me know if you’d like to proceed with those, or I can set up a CI workflow next.
```
```progress
The CLI demo `lattice_sweep_demo.py` is in place and the progress log reflects it. The remaining tasks:

1. Add V&V and UQ tracker entries for lattice solver validation.
2. Ensure the `solve_klein_gordon` integration is fully implemented (already updated earlier).

Next, I’ll update the V&V and UQ ndjson files with validation and uncertainty tasks for the lattice solver. Let me know if that aligns!
```
```progress
Unit tests for the lattice QFT solver and energy density are in place, and the progress log reflects that. Next up:

1. Building the CLI demo at `scripts/lattice_sweep_demo.py`.
2. Updating V&V and UQ trackers with new lattice solver tasks.
3. Adding finite-difference time integration logic to `solve_klein_gordon`.
```
```progress
I’ve scaffolded `parameter_sweep.py` for 1+1D lattice QFT sweeps and updated the progress log to reflect that. Next up:

1. Creating unit tests in `tests/test_lattice_energy.py`.
2. Developing a CLI demo script `scripts/lattice_sweep_demo.py`.
3. Adding corresponding V&V/UQ tasks.
```
```oldest-progress
I created a merge_wip.sh helper to install MPB via conda and merge all `wip` branches into `main` across your specified repos, then push the last one. You can run it directly to consolidate updates
