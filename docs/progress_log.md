# Progress Log

## 2025-08-01

### Repository Status
- Negative-energy-generator framework repository active; core QFT backend and analysis modules implemented.

### Completed to Date
- Implemented core simulation methods: `local_energy_density`, `find_negative`, `evolve_QFT`, `build_quantum_op_tensor`, `detect_exotics`, and `verify_conservation`.
- Defined Verification & Validation (V&V) tasks in `VnV-TODO.ndjson` and Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) tasks in `UQ-TODO.ndjson` for QFT backend features.
- Created `docs/literature_review.md` summarizing key publications on macroscopic negative energy sources.

### In Progress
- Integration tests for stress-energy conservation (`verify_conservation`).
- UQ experiments: Monte Carlo sampling, time-step sensitivity, grid resolution analysis for QFT outputs.
- Implementing 1+1D lattice QFT solver in `src/simulation/lattice_qft.py` for real scalar fields (finite-difference Klein–Gordon).
- Developed parameter sweep orchestrator in `src/simulation/parameter_sweep.py` for ansatz and grid sweeps.
- Created unit tests in `tests/test_lattice_energy.py` validating energy density calculations and solver output shapes.
- Created command-line demo `scripts/lattice_sweep_demo.py` showcasing sweep execution and result summaries.
- Created discretization accuracy test in `tests/test_lattice_discretization.py` verifying discrete Laplacian against analytical solution.
- Scaffolding GitHub Actions CI workflow in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- Added `pandas` to project dependencies and CI install step to satisfy data-frame tests.
- Created semiclassical backreaction module in `src/simulation/backreaction.py`.
- Developed backreaction CLI demo `scripts/backreaction_demo.py` with HDF5 export.
- Added integration tests in `tests/test_backreaction.py` and `tests/test_backreaction_export.py`.

### Next Tasks
1. Update V&V and UQ trackers with tasks for lattice solver validation and uncertainty quantification of lattice energy densities.
2. Implement finite-difference time-integration in `solve_klein_gordon` for dynamic field evolution.
3. Configure CI workflow (e.g., GitHub Actions) to run unit tests, integration tests, and CLI demo automatically.
4. Implement integration test for HDF5 export result validation (`test_parameter_sweep_export.py`).
5. Review and optimize time-integration accuracy in `solve_klein_gordon` based on discretization test outcomes.
6. Test and iterate on the CI workflow to ensure it runs unit tests and the CLI demo successfully.
7. Complete and validate the dynamic field evolution against discretization tests.
8. Add integration tests for HDF5 export result validation in `tests/test_parameter_sweep_export.py`.
9. Extend CI workflow to include backreaction demo execution and export validation.
10. Refine documentation for backreaction API and usage examples in `docs/future-directions.md`.
11. Analyze numerical stability of metric evolution and adjust solver parameters.
12. Integrate backreaction UQ sensitivity tasks into automated analysis pipeline.
13. Review overall CI to ensure all demos (lattice_sweep and backreaction) run successfully.
- Re-run CI to confirm fix.
- Proceed with writing HDF5 export integration test.
- Run `pytest` locally under the updated environment to replicate CI and collect any remaining errors.
- Validate the CLI demo execution locally to ensure imports resolve correctly.
- Install `pandas` locally in the venv and run `pytest` to validate all tests pass.
- Verify CLI demo runs correctly under the updated environment.
- Push changes and trigger CI to confirm remote workflow success.
- Proceed with dynamic field evolution validation.

### Progress Update
- Changed CI workflow matrix `python-version` to block sequence to resolve YAML parsing errors.
- Updated CI install step to install core dependencies (`numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `h5py`, `pytest`) before installing the package to resolve test import errors.
- All tests passed locally under updated environment.
- CLI demo executed successfully, generated HDF5 output as expected.
- Modified CI install commands to use `python -m pip install` consistently, ensuring correct interpreter usage.
- Bumped SciPy requirement to `>=1.11` to match available wheels for Python 3.12 and avoid install failures.
- Added `pytest.ini` to configure test discovery under `tests/` and set `pythonpath = src`, simplifying local and CI runs.

## 2025-08-06

### In Progress
- Added `test_time_integration_basic.py` to validate `solve_klein_gordon` output shapes and finite values.

### Next Tasks
- Run the new test locally and confirm CI compatibility.
- Refine time integration accuracy by comparing against analytical solution for small dt.

### Progress Update
- Enhanced `compute_energy_density` to accept `dx` and normalize spatial gradient; updated tests accordingly.
- Energy conservation test passed with proper gradient normalization.
- Analytical solution comparison test passed, confirming correct sign inversion at half period.

### Next Tasks
- Adjust solver parameters (e.g., reduce `dt`) to improve accuracy and reduce numerical dispersion.
- Integrate dynamic evolution accuracy benchmarks into CI as additional pytest jobs.
- Begin writing documentation for solver API and usage examples.

```latest-progress
I’ve implemented the semiclassical backreaction module and demo, added export tests, and updated the progress log. Next I’ll integrate the backreaction demo into CI, enhance backreaction documentation, and refine solver stability. 
```
```progress
I’ve added V&V tests for the `solve_semiclassical_metric` function and a UQ task for T00 sensitivity in backreaction. The roadmap is expanding through all three future-direction stages. 

Next, I’ll set up the CI workflow file adjustments if needed, or begin writing the HDF5 export integration test.
```
```progress
Gradient normalization was added to `compute_energy_density`, and the energy conservation test now passes. The analytical solution inversion is confirmed. I updated the progress log. Next, we can refine solver parameters to improve accuracy, integrate these benchmarks into CI, or start writing solver API documentation. 
```
```progress
I added a pytest.ini to target tests under tests and automatically include src in `PYTHONPATH`, streamlining test discovery and import resolution. Updated the progress log. Next, I'll rerun both local and CI tests to confirm everything passes, then start on dynamic field evolution accuracy comparisons.
```
```progress
I updated the CI install steps to consistently use `python -m pip install`, and bumped SciPy to `>=1.11` for Python 3.12 wheel support. The progress log reflects these changes. Next, we should trigger CI to verify the remote workflow, then continue with dynamic field evolution accuracy testing.
```
```progress
The basic time integration test passed locally. I updated progress_log.md. Next, I’ll refine the solver’s accuracy like comparing to analytical solution for small `dt`.
```
```progress
Local tests and the CLI demo ran successfully. The `pandas` dependency resolved the test failures, and the demo generated expected output. I updated the progress log—next, I’ll push these changes so CI can verify the remote workflow, then proceed with dynamic field evolution validation. 
```
```progress
I added a CI step to export `PYTHONPATH` pointing to src, which should fix import errors for the `simulation` package in both tests and the CLI demo. Updated the progress log accordingly. Next, I’ll rerun CI and address any further packaging issues.
```
```progress
Logged the new HDF5 export test implementation in progress_log.md. Next, I'll run pytest locally, fix any import or packaging issues, and ensure the `simulation` module installs correctly so CI tests pass.
```
```progress
I switched the Python version matrix to a block sequence format to ensure YAML validity. Updated the progress log. Next up is rerunning CI to confirm the fix, then implementing the HDF5 export integration test.
```
```progress
I fixed the YAML indentation for the `strategy` block under `jobs.build` so the CI syntax is valid. Updated the progress log. Next, I'll implement the HDF5 export integration test at `tests/test_parameter_sweep_export.py`.
```
```progress
I’ve quoted the Python versions in the CI matrix to prevent YAML misinterpretation (3.10 became 3.1). The workflow now correctly picks up 3.10 and 3.12. I updated the progress log—next, I’ll write the HDF5 export integration test.
```
```progress
I’ve scaffolded the GitHub Actions CI workflow at ci.yml to install dependencies, run unit tests, and execute the CLI demo. The progress_log.md is updated accordingly. Next up, I’ll implement finite-difference time integration validation against discretization tests and write the HDF5 export integration test.
```
```progress
I’ll proceed to implement `solve_klein_gordon`’s time integration in lattice_qft.py. 
```
```progress
I’ve added a discretization unit test for the Laplacian and updated the progress log. Next, I recommend setting up a CI workflow to automatically run all tests and the CLI demo—ensuring stability—and writing the HDF5 export integration test. I can scaffold a GitHub Actions config if you’d like.
```
```oldest-progress
V&V and UQ trackers updated with high- and medium-priority tasks for the lattice QFT solver, HDF5 exports, and parameter sensitivities. The progress log and test/demo scripts are in place. Next, I recommend implementing the discretization unit test or refining the solver's accuracy. Let me know if you’d like to proceed with those, or I can set up a CI workflow next.
