27. Update V&V tasks in `VnV-TODO.ndjson` to include spatial backreaction validation.
28. Run CI to confirm wave propagation solver and tests pass under the updated model.
29. Document backreaction wave solver assumptions and equations in `docs/technical-documentation.md`.

### Progress Update
- Changed CI workflow matrix `python-version` to block sequence to resolve YAML parsing errors.
- Updated CI install step to install core dependencies (`numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `h5py`, `pytest`) before installing the package to resolve test import errors.
- All tests passed locally under updated environment.
- CLI demo executed successfully, generated HDF5 output as expected.
- Modified CI install commands to use `python -m pip install` consistently, ensuring correct interpreter usage.
- Bumped SciPy requirement to `>=1.11` to match available wheels for Python 3.12 and avoid install failures.
- Added `pytest.ini` to configure test discovery under `tests/` and set `pythonpath = src`, simplifying local and CI runs.

## 2025-08-06

### In Progress
- Added `test_time_integration_basic.py` to validate `solve_klein_gordon` output shapes and finite values.

### Next Tasks

- Begin writing documentation for solver API and usage examples.

```latest-progress
Next, I'll integrate this stability check into CI, update V&V tasks for spatial backreaction, and start documenting the backreaction API in technical-documentation.md.
```
```progress
I’ve added a stability test matching the theoretical growth pattern for constant T00, and updated the progress log with next tasks to integrate this into CI, extend the solver, and update docs. CI now consistently covers demos and tests.
```
```progress
Survey script fixed and rerun successfully, and CI updated to execute the backreaction demo. I've updated the progress log with those changes. Now, I'll analyze external_survey.json to identify candidate modules to integrate. 
```
```progress
I’ve added a `survey_repos.py` script to catalog functions in the target repos, and updated the progress log with tasks to run the survey, identify useful modules, and integrate them into our project. Next step: run the survey, review the results, and begin importing relevant functions.
```
```progress
I’ve added tasks to survey and integrate relevant modules from the listed repos (Lorentz violation, ANEC, unified LQG, and warp-bubble QFT/density) into our macroscopic negative energy framework. Next, I can begin exploration in each repo and propose specific code imports or adaptations...
```
```progress
I’ve implemented the semiclassical backreaction module and demo, added export tests, and updated the progress log. Next I’ll integrate the backreaction demo into CI, enhance backreaction documentation, and refine solver stability. 
```
```progress
I’ve added V&V tests for the `solve_semiclassical_metric` function and a UQ task for T00 sensitivity in backreaction. The roadmap is expanding through all three future-direction stages. 

Next, I’ll set up the CI workflow file adjustments if needed, or begin writing the HDF5 export integration test.
```
```progress
Gradient normalization was added to `compute_energy_density`, and the energy conservation test now passes. The analytical solution inversion is confirmed. I updated the progress log. Next, we can refine solver parameters to improve accuracy, integrate these benchmarks into CI, or start writing solver API documentation. 
```
```progress
I added a pytest.ini to target tests under tests and automatically include src in `PYTHONPATH`, streamlining test discovery and import resolution. Updated the progress log. Next, I'll rerun both local and CI tests to confirm everything passes, then start on dynamic field evolution accuracy comparisons.
```
```progress
I updated the CI install steps to consistently use `python -m pip install`, and bumped SciPy to `>=1.11` for Python 3.12 wheel support. The progress log reflects these changes. Next, we should trigger CI to verify the remote workflow, then continue with dynamic field evolution accuracy testing.
```
```progress
The basic time integration test passed locally. I updated progress_log.md. Next, I’ll refine the solver’s accuracy like comparing to analytical solution for small `dt`.
```
```progress
Local tests and the CLI demo ran successfully. The `pandas` dependency resolved the test failures, and the demo generated expected output. I updated the progress log—next, I’ll push these changes so CI can verify the remote workflow, then proceed with dynamic field evolution validation. 
```
```progress
I added a CI step to export `PYTHONPATH` pointing to src, which should fix import errors for the `simulation` package in both tests and the CLI demo. Updated the progress log accordingly. Next, I’ll rerun CI and address any further packaging issues.
```
```progress
Logged the new HDF5 export test implementation in progress_log.md. Next, I'll run pytest locally, fix any import or packaging issues, and ensure the `simulation` module installs correctly so CI tests pass.
```
```progress
I switched the Python version matrix to a block sequence format to ensure YAML validity. Updated the progress log. Next up is rerunning CI to confirm the fix, then implementing the HDF5 export integration test.
```
```oldest-progress
I fixed the YAML indentation for the `strategy` block under `jobs.build` so the CI syntax is valid. Updated the progress log. Next, I'll implement the HDF5 export integration test at `tests/test_parameter_sweep_export.py`.
```
