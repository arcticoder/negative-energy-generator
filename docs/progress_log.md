# Progress Log

## 2025-08-01

### Repository Status
- Negative-energy-generator framework repository active; core QFT backend and analysis modules implemented.

### Completed to Date
- Implemented core simulation methods: `local_energy_density`, `find_negative`, `evolve_QFT`, `build_quantum_op_tensor`, `detect_exotics`, and `verify_conservation`.
- Defined Verification & Validation (V&V) tasks in `VnV-TODO.ndjson` and Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) tasks in `UQ-TODO.ndjson` for QFT backend features.

### In Progress
- Integration tests for stress-energy conservation (`verify_conservation`).
- UQ experiments: Monte Carlo sampling, time-step sensitivity, grid resolution analysis for QFT outputs.

### Next Tasks
1. Conduct a comprehensive literature review on macroscopic negative energy sources (e.g., Casimir cavities, squeezed vacuum states).
2. Design an experimental setup to measure negative energy density in laboratory-scale Casimir plate arrays.
3. Develop a simulation module modeling macro-scale Casimir configurations (multi-plate geometries).
4. Prototype a data acquisition and analysis pipeline for exotic matter detection using precision sensors.
5. Update V&V and UQ trackers with tasks for experimental validation and uncertainty analysis of negative energy measurements.
