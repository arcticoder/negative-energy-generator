# Future Directions

This document outlines the planned enhancements and exploratory objectives for the Negative Energy Generator framework.

## 1. Toy QFT Physics Backend

Implement a unified PhysicsCore interface in `src/simulation/qft_backend.py` that:

1. Defines a parametric ansatz for the stress-energy tensor  
   \[ T_{μν}(x; α, β, …) \]
2. Evaluates the local energy density
   \[ ρ(x) = T_{μν} u^μ u^ν \]
   on a user-specified grid
3. Flags regions where ρ(x) < 0
4. Hands off negative-energy regions to QFT exploratory tools for further state discovery

Key deliverables:
- `PhysicsCore.build_LQG_tensor` toy implementation
- `PhysicsCore.local_energy_density` and `PhysicsCore.find_negative`
- Integration with grid-based QFT modules for state evolution

## 2. Field-Only Parameter Sweeps (1+1D Scalar Fields)

Develop custom lattice code for a real scalar field in 1+1D to explore exotic stress-energy inputs:

1. Treat injected T_{μν}(x) as pure input, decoupled from backreaction
2. Include automated self-tests:
   - Energy condition checkers  
   - Constraint monitors
3. Leverage existing engines where possible:
   - Sympy / NumPy for symbolic & numeric routines  
   - QuTiP for prototype few-mode cavity tests (not scalable)
4. Simulate standard physical sources:
   - Classical scalar fields  
   - Squeezed vacuum approximations  
   - Casimir plate models
5. Invent and inject user-defined T_{μν}(x) with arbitrary, mathematically consistent profiles
6. Discretize the Klein–Gordon Hamiltonian
7. Build mode operators and prepare vacuum or squeezed states
8. Compute ⟨T_{00}⟩ numerically over the lattice

## 3. Semiclassical Backreaction in 1+1D

Once negative-energy states are identified, extend to include first-order backreaction using semiclassical gravity:

1. Implement 1+1D Einstein equations:
   \[ G_{μν} = 8πG \langle T_{μν} \rangle \]
2. Couple lattice-derived ⟨T_{μν}⟩ into a toy metric evolution solver
3. Analyze stability and evolution of the metric under exotic stress-energy inputs

Future phases may include:
- Automated parameter sweeps over ansatz parameters (α, β, …)  
- Integration with higher-dimensional lattice engines for 2+1D or 3+1D models  
- Visualization tools for negative-energy region mapping  
- Uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis modules
