### 📊 Current Performance:

**Individual Components (Working Correctly):**
- Wormhole ANEC: Positive (as expected for current geometry)
- Casimir ANEC: **-4.60×10¹⁶ J·s·m⁻³** ✅ (Strongly negative!)
- Squeezed ANEC: **-1.68×10⁻²⁴ J·s·m⁻³** ✅ (Negative, but small magnitude)
- 3-loop corrections: Functional and stable

**Integration Challenge:**
- **Total ANEC: +5.59×10²⁵ J·s·m⁻³** (Positive due to wormhole dominance)
- Wormhole positive energy overwhelms negative contributions by factor of ~10⁹
- Current optimization reaches ~6×10¹⁹ J·s·m⁻³ (improving, but still positive)

### 🔧 Progress Tracking Improvements:

**✅ Added Features:**
- Real-time optimization progress with evaluation counts
- Stagnation detection (stops after 200 evaluations without improvement)
- Maximum evaluation limits (prevents infinite loops)
- Early termination when targets achieved
- Comprehensive diagnostic analysis

**✅ Timeout Mechanisms:**
- Maximum evaluations: 100-1000 (configurable)
- Stagnation threshold: 200 evaluations without 1% improvement
- Progress reporting every 50 evaluations
- Early success termination

### 🔍 Diagnostic Insights:

**Problem Root Cause:**
1. Wormhole geometry produces ~10²⁵ J·s·m⁻³ positive energy density
2. Casimir/squeezed negative contributions are ~10⁹ times smaller
3. Need either:
   - Much stronger negative energy sources, OR
   - Fundamentally different wormhole geometry, OR
   - Better spatial localization of negative vs positive regions

**Recommendations from Diagnostic:**
- Try smaller throat radius (r₀)
- Increase exotic matter strength (Δ)
- Improve spatial localization of negative energy contributions
- Consider alternative wormhole ansatz (Krasnikov vs Morris-Thorne)

## 🎯 Next Phase Options:

### Option A: Mathematical Redesign
- Implement Krasnikov tube geometry (different from Morris-Thorne)
- Add traversable wormhole with engineered negative energy dominance
- Explore Alcubierre-like metrics with better negative/positive balance

### Option B: Enhanced Negative Sources
- Implement vacuum polarization effects
- Add dynamic Casimir enhancement with stronger modulation
- Include additional quantum field effects (Hawking radiation analogs)

### Option C: Hybrid Approach
- Combine best-performing individual components
- Focus on Casimir-dominated regions with minimal wormhole interference
- Implement multi-scale analysis (separate near/far field regions)

## 🚀 Technical Achievement Summary:

**✅ Fully Functional Framework:**
- All theoretical components implemented and tested
- Parameter optimization with intelligent timeout
- Progress tracking preventing infinite loops
- Comprehensive diagnostic capabilities
