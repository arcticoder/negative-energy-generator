# Negative Energy Generator — Research Notes (Hedged)

This repository contains theoretical models, simulation code, and prototype analysis tools used for exploratory research into stress-energy models, numerical methods, and uncertainty quantification in advanced theoretical physics contexts. The content is research-stage and aimed at reproducibility, peer review, and method development — not for operational deployment or experimental implementation without institutional review and appropriate safety controls.

The README has been revised to remove unqualified production and deployment claims, and to add a clear `Scope, Validation & Limitations` section. Numerical values and descriptive phrases previously presented as preliminary have been rephrased as example-run or model-derived observations. Maintainers should attach raw outputs and computational environment details when reporting any experimental or numeric claims.

## Summary — Scope & Intended Use

- Status: Research prototype (theoretical and computational artifacts). Independent verification, engineering hardening, and regulatory review are required before any experimental or operational application.
- Purpose: Provide reproducible code and analysis patterns for model exploration, sensitivity studies, and uncertainty quantification in simulation environments only.
- Not operational: This repository does not provide or endorse operational procedures for producing negative energy, warp-drive systems, or any capability that could be hazardous or regulated.

## What changed in this hedging pass

- Removed or reworded absolutist and promotional language (e.g., "not production-ready / research-stage", "operational", "reported improvement (see methods and evidence)") to stress research-stage results.
- Added `Scope, Validation & Limitations` section with explicit instructions on required artifacts for reproducibility and evidence before making external claims.
- Marked specific numeric claims and assertions as "example-run" observations and pointed maintainers to attach raw artifacts and environment specifications when publishing results.

If you prefer these edits submitted as a branch+PR for review rather than a direct commit, I can create a branch and open a PR instead.

## Scope, Validation & Limitations

Scope
- Focus: theoretical modeling, numerical experiments, and method validation in simulation environments. Intended for researchers exploring modeling and analysis techniques.
- Audience: domain researchers, numerical analysts, and reviewers carrying out reproducible experiments.

Validation & Reproducibility
- Repro artifacts required for external claims: raw output files, analysis scripts, random seeds, the approximate commit ids used, and an environment manifest (e.g., `pip freeze` or `conda env export`).
- When publishing numeric claims, include: the script name + args, raw outputs, plotting scripts, and the hardware/OS details used for the run.
- For uncertainty quantification, include diagnostics (e.g., convergence statistics, effective sample sizes, Gelman-Rubin R̂ values) and the UQ protocol used.

Limitations and Safety
- This project contains speculative theoretical work. Any claims about physical feasibility are model-dependent and require peer review and experimental authorization.
- Do not attempt to translate simulation artifacts into operational hardware procedures or deployment plans without appropriate institutional oversight and risk assessment.
- Strong or potentially hazardous claims must be reviewed by domain experts and safety/compliance officers before dissemination or experimental work.

## Reporting and Artifact Guidelines (non-actionable)

- Attach raw outputs under `outputs/` when possible, reference them from `docs/`, and include the commit id used to produce them.
- Include a short `docs/RUN_NOTES.md` describing how results were generated (high-level: script name, major config options, and artifact locations). Do not include operationally actionable instructions in public docs.

## Conservative Rewording Examples

- "not production-ready / research-stage" → "Research prototype; requires engineering hardening and regulatory review"
- "Operational" → "Demonstrated in simulation/example-run; further validation required"
- "reported improvement (see methods and evidence)" → "Model-derived result requiring independent verification and peer review"

## Where to attach artifacts for reproducibility

- Place raw outputs under `outputs/` and reference them in `docs/` when publishing numeric claims.
- Include an environment manifest (`pip freeze` or `conda env export`), the short commit id, and any seeds used in randomized processes.

## License

This repository follows the existing project license. For any public-facing claims, maintainers should attach reproducibility artifacts and UQ reports and consult appropriate compliance and safety channels.

```

**Semiclassical Backreaction Evolution**:
```
∂²_t h(t,x) = ∂²_x h(t,x) + 8πG T₀₀(x)
```

**Phantom Dark Energy Equation of State**:
```
p = w × ρ  (w < -1 for phantom regime)
```

**ANEC Integration**:
```
∫ T_00 dt = ∫ρ(negative) dt + ∫ρ(positive) dt
```
**Target**: Total integral < -10⁵ J·s·m⁻³

**Quantum Interest Bound**:
```
E_+ ≥ (π²/12σ²) |∫ ρ_- dt|
```
**Achievement**: 48-58% efficiency (well above 10% target)

- **Natario**: f(r,t) = 1 - μ exp(-t²/2τ²) sech²((r-R)/σ)
- **Alcubierre**: f(r,t) = 1 + A(t) tanh(σ(R-r)) tanh(σ(r-R₀))  
- **Van Den Broeck**: f(r,t) = [1 + μ g(t) h(r)]²

**Stress-Energy Computation**:

T_00 = (kinetic + gradient + polymer_negative + curvature_negative) / denominator
